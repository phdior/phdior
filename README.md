# Terminal
#### Written by: *Philippe Dior*
Hi! These are a few ***commands***:
- pwd (print working directory) [see where I'm at]
- ls (list) [see all the folders and files]
- cd (change directory) [enter a new folder]
- cd .. (Goes to the previous directory)
- cd ~ (Goes to the user Folder)
- touch (creastes a new file)
- open (Opes folders or files)
- nano (Opens text editor)
- rm (remove) [deltes]
- mkdir (Make Directory) [creates folders]
-  rmdir (remove Directory) [it only works with empty directories]
- rm -r (remove recursive) [removes directories]

Simolteniously I want to learn the structure of the Spanish Language and develop a **Spanish-teaching** App.
